Syrup2D is a game engine written in C99 with simplicity in mind. The engine allows developers to create objects with lua scripts and automatically manages resources so I don't have to. My goal with Syrup Engine is to create something I can use to develop my own projects with without being tied to and depending on a third party for my game's engine. I find that I relatively dislike working on 3D games, and a 2D engine is definitely within my reach. It may be unoptimized at the moment but I plan to work on it for a long period of time, and hopefully it'll shape up into being something worthwhile.
